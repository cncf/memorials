I had the honor of working with Cody in the Austin Kubernetes community where we hosted a few meetups together. He always loved to bring folks together and ensuring everyone felt welcome.

You will be missed, rest in peace.

I knew Cody from some Red Hat channel partners, we also both went on to work at Sysdig together. 
I was close with Cody. We shared a lot of the same passions for cooking and family. Our bond was really formed over sharing our wins and loses.
I will miss you Cody, everyday. I look forward to hugging you again brother.
