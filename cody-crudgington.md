I had the honor of working with Cody in the Austin Kubernetes community where we hosted a few meetups together. He always loved to bring folks together and ensuring everyone felt welcome.

You will be missed, rest in peace.

## Marky Jackson
I knew Cody from some Red Hat channel partners, we also both went on to work at Sysdig together. 
I was close with Cody. We shared a lot of the same passions for cooking and family. Our bond was really formed over sharing our wins and loses.
I will miss you Cody, everyday. I look forward to hugging you again brother.

I had the immense pleasure of working with Cody while I was at Sysdig. Throughout my time there, both at work and outside, he was an amazing friend. A rock to hold you down when things got rough, and always just willing to listen. We met at KubeCon San Diego before I even worked at Sysdig, and he made sure that if there was ever a moment that weekend I needed someone to hang out with, something to do, someone to help, he was there. We'd never met before, and he opened his heart to make sure that I was welcomed to the fold, without a second glance. We kept in touch here and there after we both found new jobs, he was always checking in to make sure his friends were ok. He was a genuine human being, and I count myself so so lucky to have known him.

Cody was one of those people that made the open source world feel like a real community. I was talking with Marky and told him "I don't even know how I met Cody, he was just always around". He was always there, always making everyone feel welcome. He was easy to be around, and easy to feel at ease with. The kind of person that is the glue that holds the community together.

My best memories of Cody are of a lot of great times at conferences, and hanging out on zoom way too late into the night after Kubernetes Atlanta meetups.

He'll be missed.
