## Chris Aniszczyk

I had the honor of working with Cody in the Austin Kubernetes community where we hosted a few meetups together. He always loved to bring folks together and ensuring everyone felt welcome.

You will be missed, rest in peace.

## Marky Jackson

I knew Cody from some Red Hat channel partners, we also both went on to work at Sysdig together.  
I was close with Cody. We shared a lot of the same passions for cooking and family. Our bond was really formed over sharing our wins and loses.  
I will miss you Cody, everyday. I look forward to hugging you again brother.

I had the immense pleasure of working with Cody while I was at Sysdig. Throughout my time there, both at work and outside, he was an amazing friend. A rock to hold you down when things got rough, and always just willing to listen. We met at KubeCon San Diego before I even worked at Sysdig, and he made sure that if there was ever a moment that weekend I needed someone to hang out with, something to do, someone to help, he was there. We'd never met before, and he opened his heart to make sure that I was welcomed to the fold, without a second glance. We kept in touch here and there after we both found new jobs, he was always checking in to make sure his friends were ok. He was a genuine human being, and I count myself so so lucky to have known him.

Cody was one of those people that made the open source world feel like a real community. I was talking with Marky and told him "I don't even know how I met Cody, he was just always around". He was always there, always making everyone feel welcome. He was easy to be around, and easy to feel at ease with. The kind of person that is the glue that holds the community together.

My best memories of Cody are of a lot of great times at conferences, and hanging out on zoom way too late into the night after Kubernetes Atlanta meetups.

He'll be missed.

## Chris Short

Cody and I spoke at length at KubeCon L.A. last year. We surprisingly had a lot more in common than either of us realized. Both of us had older daughters and younger sons. Our virtual encounters were almost as extraordinary as our real-life ones.

A story about Cody's selflessness and desire to make the world a better place: at KubeCon L.A., I met a friend for lunch earlier in the week who helps veterans. She asked if I could muster some attention for local homeless veterans (social media was easy, but Cody took it to another level). When I told Cody about it later that day, he said he'd come with me if I could break away from the conference. We'd meet her at the local VA to hand out supplies and assist with housing homeless veterans who were about to be removed by the same VA that is supposed to support them. He didn't hesitate, saying, "If you can get us a ride, I'll go with you." We didn't end up going due to work needs and logistics issues, but I wish we had gone and pushed work aside now.

Cody was a good person and would drop everything to help folks who needed it.

He will be truly missed.

## Mars Toktonaliev

Cody was one of the smartest and kindest humans I've ever met. 
His enthusiasm, energy and willingness to help others were shining in everything he did. We first met at one of the KubeCons and stayed in touch since then, he was always an inspiration and a true gem. I will miss him a lot.  

## Jorge Castro

I worked with Cody in the context of organizing KubeCon and other Kubernetes community functions. 
Cody always had a knack for showing up right when we needed him, right as things were getting overwhelming.

He would volunteer to help what most people call "the little things" at KubeCons, even if that meant standing there and pointing people to the right hallway.
The mood always got better when he showed up and it always subconcisouly reminded us to just have fun with what we're doing. 

I don't even remember how I met him it was like the universe randomly assigned him to make us all better and he had been there the whole time.

## Rey Lejano

I got to know Cody while working on the 2021 Kubernetes contributor awards we co-presented together. Throughout meetings leading up to the contributor celebration, as we gathered award nominees and prepared for the presentation, we got to know each other. We talked a lot about family and life transitions. At that time, my partner and I were expecting a son. Cody shared some experiences as a father that eased my anxiousness. Contributor Summits won't be the same without Cody.

## Jim Angel

Cody had special a gift of bringing people together. Cody had this magic ability to make you feel like the coolest, most welcomed, person in the room. He would always would greet me with a giant hug (that I would have to stand on my toes for lol). Whenever we were out, he'd ensure that everyone knew everyone and introduce those that didn't. Usually that would include an over-the-top story or two about the person being introduced.

I met Cody when we revamped the Austin local Kubernetes meetup. He lived not too far from me, and we'd chat at lengths about the community and how to improve the meetup. Cody's ability to get stuff done and connect people was incredible.

Cody was taken from us way too soon. Miss ya! ❤️

Cody is a warm and friendly person. When I think about his contribution to the community, I want to say thank you to him.

I will continue to work hard to contribute to the community.
