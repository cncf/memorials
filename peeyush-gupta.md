I worked with Peeyush in Kubernetes SIG Contributor Experience, and we worked closely on the APAC Coordinators team.
Peeyush was always the first one to welcome new contributors, coordinate across timezones, and drive all tasks to the finish line.
I have truly not seen anyone who is so energetic, friendly and meticulous as him. Since the APAC meeting was sparsely attended,
sometimes it used to be just Peeyush and I who showed up. I loved the candid discussions we used to have then.

We lost an extraordinary Kubernetes contributor from India. Will miss you, friend. Rest in peace.

Peeyush was a great contributpr to the Kubernetes community and my good friend. We used to discuss a lot of open source initiatives, hcktoberfest streams etc.
He was also there with me on the APAC Coordinators team and always willing to do and contribute more. We did a stream together, we used to talk for all the Kubernetes activities happening in India and how cn we amplify that, make it better. 
Really sad that I lost a good friend and a great human being. Going to miss him a lot.

Peeyush was a wonderful person and an extraordinary contributor to open-source 
projects and communities. He helped with many crucial contributions in
the OpenEBS project too. We had a couple of great discussions around open source,
community, etc. I can't forget his outstanding welcome of mine in one of the
Hacktoberfest streams. Thank you Peeyush for your outstanding contributions. We
lost a fantastic human being and contributor from India. You will be missed.

Peeyush and I worked together at IBM.  Though we worked in different geographies, it was easy to colloborate with him. He was a active community contributor keeping our IBM platforms relevant in a lot of spaces. He also eager to lend others a helping hand. Eventually I did to meet him in person during Kubecon, and got to hang out with him for a bulk of that week.  Will miss you.

## Manjunath Kumatagi

I worked with Peeyush at IBM, shared the same project and cubicle for 4+ years. Helped us making ppc64le platform supported in many cloud opensource projects and also one of the active opensource contributor. We just lost a great human being and a good friend. I'm going to miss him for sure.

May God give enough strength to the family to bear the irreparable loss, Rest in peace.

Peeyush had one of the most wonderful and friendly smiles that he graciously shared with anyone that he met. His smiling demeanor made all the difference in helping the first-timers to Bangalore Meetups feel at ease. I met him at one such event and he remained a constant source of inspiration in helping the Bangalore community grow. It was awesome to see his open-source trajectory from being a contributor to organizing Hacktoberfests and becoming a core maintainer on the projects. He was a living example of an individual who put community before company. I still can't believe that - just a couple of weeks before the loss hit, he was helping us with preparing for BugBash for the KubeCon EU. His sudden loss has left me rattled. I truly wish that all the goodness that he offered to the world can help in providing the much-required strength and support to the loved ones he left behind. Rest in peace.
