# In Memory of Peeyush Gupta

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Peeyush and what he meant to us in one place.

I worked with Peeyush in Kubernetes SIG Contributor Experience, and we worked closely on the APAC Coordinators team.
Peeyush was always the first one to welcome new contributors, coordinate across timezones, and drive all tasks to the finish line.
I have truly not seen anyone who is so energetic, friendly and meticulous as him. Since the APAC meeting was sparsely attended,
sometimes it used to be just Peeyush and I who showed up. I loved the candid discussions we used to have then.

We lost an extraordinary Kubernetes contributor from India. Will miss you, friend. Rest in peace.

Peeyush was a great contributpr to the Kubernetes community and my good friend. We used to discuss a lot of open source initiatives, hcktoberfest streams etc.
He was also there with me on the APAC Coordinators team and always willing to do and contribute more. We did a stream together, we used to talk for all the Kubernetes activities happening in India and how cn we amplify that, make it better. 
Really sad that I lost a good friend and a great human being. Going to miss him a lot.
