# In Memory of Dan Kohn

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Dan and what he meant to us in one place.

## Chris Aniszczyk

I first met Dan as I was bootstrapping CNCF and we were entering our crazy growth phase and needed to expand the team. While Dan and I didn't always agree on everything,
I had the pleasure of working with Dan on a daily basis the last few years cultivating CNCF and other LF projects. Dan was committed to building a global and diverse community, 
he always took the time to chat with community members all over the world and ensured that CNCF was using its resources to uplift the community.  We spent many hours on the road 
together away from family which can be tough for a father with young children. However, Dan always ensured that he would bring something back for the kids, or
better yet, find a way to bring them along to involve them in the community like handing our swag at our event in India earlier this year. After CNCF, Dan's next
project was establishing LF Public Health as a shared resource not just to fight COVID-19 but to combat future health crises. LFPH has already seen success and 
is bringing the spirit of open source to global health authorities. 

I will miss our fun conversations and plans... while I have lost a close friend, we have also lost a tireless champion for open source across the world.

My last message to Dan, which he didn't see:

Dan, I heard the news from Jim and I’m devastated. Thank you for everything you’ve done for the open source community and for me personally. You’ve changed the world in ways that very few people have, and that impact will live on. You’ve certainly changed the trajectory of my career and thousands others, and we’ll take good care of everything you’ve worked so hard for. Thank you again and all my love to you and your family.

I met Dan while he was working at Spreemo, then followed him to the CNCF. He was the best boss I have ever had in my life. For the first time, I had a boss, a mentor, and a loyal friend at the same time. It was thanks to Dan that I had my first opportunity to visit the world. We met many times, practically at every KubeCon conference. We often discussed things not related to work, such as traveling. We have worked together for over five years. Dan was a wonderful man, and the news of his sudden and premature death saddened and surprised me. Rest in peace, dear friend—sincere condolences to the whole family.
