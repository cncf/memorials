# In Memory of Dan Kohn

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Dan and what he meant to us in one place.

## Chris Aniszczyk

I first met Dan as I was bootstrapping CNCF and we were entering our crazy growth phase and needed to expand the team. While Dan and I didn't always agree on everything,
I had the pleasure of working with Dan on a daily basis the last few years cultivating CNCF and other LF projects. Dan was committed to building a global and diverse community, 
he always took the time to chat with community members all over the world and ensured that CNCF was using its resources to uplift the community.  We spent many hours on the road 
together away from family which can be tough for a father with young children. However, Dan always ensured that he would bring something back for the kids, or
better yet, find a way to bring them along to involve them in the community like handing our swag at our event in India earlier this year. After CNCF, Dan's next
project was establishing LF Public Health as a shared resource not just to fight COVID-19 but to combat future health crises. LFPH has already seen success and 
is bringing the spirit of open source to global health authorities. 

I will miss our fun conversations and plans... while I have lost a close friend, we have also lost a tireless champion for open source across the world.

My last message to Dan, which he didn't see:

Dan, I heard the news from Jim and I’m devastated. Thank you for everything you’ve done for the open source community and for me personally. You’ve changed the world in ways that very few people have, and that impact will live on. You’ve certainly changed the trajectory of my career and thousands others, and we’ll take good care of everything you’ve worked so hard for. Thank you again and all my love to you and your family.

I met Dan while he was working at Spreemo, then followed him to the CNCF. He was the best boss I have ever had in my life. For the first time, I had a boss, a mentor, and a loyal friend at the same time. It was thanks to Dan that I had my first opportunity to visit the world. We met many times, practically at every KubeCon conference. We often discussed things not related to work, such as traveling. We have worked together for over five years. Dan was a wonderful man, and the news of his sudden and premature death saddened and surprised me. Rest in peace, dear friend—sincere condolences to the whole family.

## Ihor Dvoretskyi

I saw Dan for the first time at the keynote stage in Seattle during KubeCon'2016. These were the early days of the Kubernetes community and CNCF in general, but I was definitely impressed by the presentation made by this tall and loud gentleman.

A bit less than year later I've joined CNCF as a full-time staff member, and ability to work closely with Dan was one of the primary reasons why I made this decision. Despite the fact that I haven't reported to Dan directly, I felt his impact on the whole organization, on all of us, on an every single person within CNCF. He also was a kind and polite person who has helped me to steer in the woods of uncertainty at some points of my career.

Dan was a truly extraordinary person, and his impact on the whole open source industry is significant. I have a strong feeling that most of us (including myself) would not be there where we are now and would not do what we are doing now if we'd not met Dan.

Thank you, Dan.

## Kim McMahon

Dan had a massive positive influence on my life and career. He believed and fought for me when others would not. He is an amazing mentor to me and his advice and guidance is something I use every day. I am in an amazing career at an amazing company because of Dan and I can’t thank him enough. 

Dan, as I, am an introvert in an extrovert field. I will never forget our almost-dinner at MWC in Barcelona. People were dropping out of going to the conference, but Dan and I were still going to go if the conference was held! I suggested we have dinner together. Dan told me that he doesn't really like people, so we would go to dinner together, sit at different tables in the same restaurant, and just read out books (or whatever). With us both being introverts - it was going to be the best dinner ever! :)

I will forever hear his laugh. And I leave one word: Grammerly. :)

## Jim Haughwout

Dan was not only a tremendous leader in the open source community, but a kind person who made all feel welcome. I still remember meeting him at my first KubeCon event, at the Tivoli in Copenhagen. He will be missed--but not forgotten. His work is now being carried on by a 100,000+ committers, building a better community for all. RIP!

## Joe Beda

The last several years of my life have been intimately entangled with Kubernetes and the CNCF.  And Dan was a fundamental part of making the CNCF what it is.  I didn't always agree with him, but it was always above board.  He always worked hard to balance all of the various forces to create win-win situations and success for everyone involved.  Whenever we met at a conference or event he was always easy to talk to and clearly cared about fostering a community.

The big thing I'll remember Dan for is his work and dedication for including, diversity and equity.  In multiple instances Dan would go beyond what was easy to really try and move the our community (and, by small increments, the larger industry) forward.  He really worked to make sure that KubeCon (and the CNCF as a whole) were at the forefront of things like diversity scholorships. I know that this had an impact on *many* in our community.  Beyond just KubeCon, he took feedback around diversity in the governing structure of the CNCF (TOC, GB) very seriously.  He put himself out on a limb multiple times to do the right thing to lead in this space.  I was and am impressed with his commitment.

Goodbye Dan. You will be missed.

## T.E.Shaw

I worked w/ Dan on the foundations of the Linux Foundation Public Health. Even though I'm myself 40 years in computing, I decided to be his tea boy and learn from his clear vision and meticulous way of work. The fire he ignited will burn for a long time.

## John Mertic

Dan taught me by example on how to be a leader in an open source foundation, with his focus on putting the community first and always making sure the work output reflected how much he put that community first. He was one of the few that would reach out with words of encouragement as I was navigating the foundations I was leading, and always willing to jump in as a speaker or make connections to help the community thrive.

Landscapes were one of his passions. I remember him helping me at a moments notice, proactively making adjustments and getting logos fixed to ensure it looked great ( along with the occasional lesson on SVG quality ;-) ). Even once it was launched, he would often get to pull requests faster than I could! I remember thanking him and telling him he didn't need to do that, and he told me "I enjoy it. It's the one part of my job that has clear outcomes." 

Dan - you are gone ( too soon ) but will never be forgotten.

## Julie Dam

I met Dan in the summer of 2016. He was late to our appointment, having had a not-so-great briefing with a reporter who didn't seem to get what he was pitching. He was making the rounds, talking about Kubernetes and containers, and not everyone was ready to get on the bandwagon yet. He showed me the same deck that hadn't impressed that reporter and told me about his plans for CNCF, including holding big conferences around the world. 

That day, he took a chance on me, a former celebrity magazine editor, figuring that even if I didn't know what a cluster was, I knew how to tell a story. And his plans included having many end users with stories to tell.

Sure enough, over the next few years, I wrote *lots* of case studies, and when we'd see each other at a KubeCon in Berlin or Shanghai, he'd give me a knowing smile: See? What did I tell you?

One of the last times I spoke to Dan, he asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. That made me laugh then. But now I think of it as his way of saying that there's always more to do in life, new things to start, new stories to tell. Dan, I wish we'd been lucky enough to see everything you were going to do when you grew up. I'm grateful to have known you.

## Richard "RichiH" Hartmann

Working with Dan on the background bits of Prometheus over the years, he was always kind, smart, thoughtful, and to the point. CNCF would not nearly be the same without him. Dan shaped a large part of how technology will develop in the next years.

The last time we talked was a few months ago and he seemed unhappy, more concerned. Given how stressful life is, how he was bootstrapping LF Public Health, and how COVID had ravaged NYC, I brushed it off and didn't follow up more closely. If only I had...

Even more important than his technical legacy, he has a legacy in his family, in his children; it was always obvious how deeply he cared about them and I hope that they will look back - while not happily about the loss - happily and positively at the person, and about their shared time.

2020 is not the easiest of years and I will miss the banter, the shared passion, and the jokes. Goodbye friend, goodbye.


## Kylix

I bursted with tears when I read Julie's Tweet about Dan's passing. Like 1000s of others in the CNCF, and Open Source community, Dan had a mountainous impact on my life, career, goals, and studies. For the past three years, Dan had been my father figure. My days would start with exchanging a greeting with Dan enquiring "Hello Sir, How are you? How is your day over there?". We have chatted days into nights and nights into days, touching on every face of life, career, technology, community, and much more. He had been my true well wisher and been a great mentor all the while. He took a deep personal interest in my Kubernetes journey from the day we met, to the day of his passing. I couldn't imagine my days without Dan's presence. He has always been my go to person for anything Kubernetes, Docker, containers, and entire cloud native eco-system. He had one of the amazingly impressive personalities in my life. He was the beacon that guided me to CNCF Meetups. His deep personal interest in my learning has brought me to great heights in my journey, and gave me the wonderful and challenging opportunities to learn and explore the CNCF landscape. Dan strongly encouraged me to participate in every Kubernetes events and certifications. Dan was not only a tremendous leader but also a visionary leader. He was very kind to me and everyone out there. He has been a catalyst in sprint after sprint of my career. Like CNCF, I also forever grateful and thankful to Dan.

For the world, CNCF, and Open Source community, Dan always had been an extraordinary person. He will forever remain in the DNA of CNCF and Open Source community. Thank you very much Dan.

I only imagine that by now, in the afterlife, God and Dan having an intense brainstorming session about setting up a conference to make people happier, and bringing more joy to them.  And, that his phone buzzes with Slack message in my signature words "Hello Sir, How are you ? How is your day over there ?"

I really miss you Dan. With tears and sadness. 

## Eduardo Silva

I cannot remember the exact date when I met Dan for the first time, but it was in a very early stage of CNCF. Every time that I had a conversation with him it was very valuable, he always had something to help with, he was a truly open person, you could talk about everything, not just technology.

I always admired his dedication, the day before KubeCon US 2016 just started, late evening, I was walking around the venue and watching how all things were being prepared for the next big day. I walked into the main theater and Dan was on the stage practicing his speech for the next day, more than just watching I was analyzing how he approached the presentation like body expressions, story, movements, etc... I wanted to learn. At that moment he kept practicing over and over to reach perfection. That's the dedication that I admire, he was truly devoted to making things perfect through discipline.

While traveling around conferences, more than once he introduces me to his family, Julie, and the kids, he is really proud of them. I was glad to see that a very busy person, had his family as priority #1.

Dan was very supportive, I could see that in the open source community, he helped to shape a huge healthy ecosystem, Fluentd won't be the same without CNCF and his help...

He will be definitely missed, his labor in this world has ended and now I am sure he is in a 'higher' level of life. His time in this world made a positive impact on many people, and that is priceless.

## Mark Atwood

I honestly cannot remember when I first met Dan.  He was one of those people that seemed to be everywhere, helping with everything, at every Linux Foundation project and event.

He was a force for good and a force for improvement, and I will miss working with him.

## Walid A. Shaari

Unlike others before me, I did not have the good fortune to know Dan or meet or listen to him in person.  However, I have known him through social media, news announcements and CNCF heroes and leaders I follow and respect; he was an inspiration and motivator to them, an inspiration to me. The technology he helped promote and foster, more importantly, the CNCF community and culture he built through collaboration, openness and inclusion. he left us an example and a legacy that will make his family, kids and us proud. Thank you, Dan, you will be missed.

## Haifeng Liu

Dan is a great helper when I joined the CNCF board, and I will always remember the meetings with Dan in Beijing, Shanghai, and San Francisco. Dan, thank you again for your leadership in building the cloud native computing communities. You will be definitely missed. 

## Rick

Dan was very friendly. I met with him several times in China. Thank him for the contribution in Open-Source.

## Chris Abraham

Dan and I interacted 97% of the time on Slack though that added up to a lot over the past few years.  I am yet another person who Dan found and brought on to the team with him believing in my abilities such that I too eventually believed.  Like many others, I was touched by his kindness, his huge intellectual capacity, and the fact that he always seemed to be available, day and night.  He seemed to have time and space for everyone.  I got to hang out with him a few times doing things like touring Shanghai by bike and going to a Soul Cycle class in NYC.  I miss working for him, his comments and approval, his attention to doing things completely and correctly, and I know it'll be a long while before I meet another mind like his.
