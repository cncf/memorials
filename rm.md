Rodolfo was one of the first people I was recommended to contact to learn more about the CNCF community in Mexico. I remember sending him a message, and he was always eager to help anyone interested in these movements.

You will always be an inspiration to everyone in the Latin American community. The legacy you left behind and the experiences you shared with those interested were truly remarkable.

Thank you, Rodo.
