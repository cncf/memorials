I worked very closely with Han for over 4 years, co-chairing SIG Instrumentation together, but consider myself lucky to have called him a friend for much longer. Without a doubt Han was an incredibly gifted engineer, and I could write a book about that as well, but much more importantly he has grown to be a close friend who I looked forward to seeing, planned meeting, and spent time with as whenever we found each other in the same place on the planet. I will always treasure the memories we created together, whether at that Brazilian steak house in San Diego, or when we grabbed a deep dish pizza in Detroit, entrusting me with details about his life he didn't even share with coworkers, or when we snuck out of KubeCon Chicago for us to get that hot dog he was craving, or even when all we had time for was to have a quick chat in the hallway. Han always took the time to listen and give a thoughful answer, but never missing out on getting a laugh in as well.

Han, my friend, you will be dearly missed. Rest in peace.
