I worked very closely with Han for over 4 years, co-chairing SIG Instrumentation together, but consider myself lucky to have called him a friend for much longer. Without a doubt Han was an incredibly gifted engineer, and I could write a book about that as well, but much more importantly he has grown to be a close friend who I looked forward to seeing, planned meeting, and spent time with as whenever we found each other in the same place on the planet. I will always treasure the memories we created together, whether at that Brazilian steak house in San Diego, or when we grabbed a deep dish pizza in Detroit, entrusting me with details about his life he didn't even share with coworkers, or when we snuck out of KubeCon Chicago for us to get that hot dog he was craving, or even when all we had time for was to have a quick chat in the hallway. Han always took the time to listen and give a thoughful answer, but never missing out on getting a laugh in as well.

Han, my friend, you will be dearly missed. Rest in peace.

I had the privilege of working with Han as part of SIG Instrumentation for several years, beginning in the shadow phase and continuing well beyond, during which time I was fortunate to learn under his mentorship. Although I never had the chance to meet him in person, the time we spent working together left a lasting impression on me. Han approached problems with a rare originality that was deeply inspiring. He was a remarkable mentor not because he taught me what to fix, but because he showed me how to think. Our hour-long one-on-ones often spanned the many facets of the SIG, and I would leave each conversation with pages of notes and action items across projects, subprojects, and even side projects, like [mad](https://github.com/rexagod/mad), whose name I vividly remember us chuckling at. While most of our discussions centered on Kubernetes, every so often we would drift into conversations about life itself. Those moments always left me more inspired, more determined, and more grateful than before. To me, Han was not just a teacher or mentor, but a role model. His accomplishments continue to amaze me, but what I value most is the confidence and guidance he gave me. I feel incredibly fortunate that our paths crossed. Han shaped my journey in ways I will never forget, and SIG Instrumentation will not be the same without him.

Rest in peace, Han.
