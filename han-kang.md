I worked very closely with Han for over 4 years, co-chairing SIG Instrumentation together, but consider myself lucky to have called him a friend for much longer. Without a doubt Han was an incredibly gifted engineer, and I could write a book about that as well, but much more importantly he has grown to be a close friend who I looked forward to seeing, planned meeting, and spent time with as whenever we found each other in the same place on the planet. I will always treasure the memories we created together, whether at that Brazilian steak house in San Diego, or when we grabbed a deep dish pizza in Detroit, entrusting me with details about his life he didn't even share with coworkers, or when we snuck out of KubeCon Chicago for us to get that hot dog he was craving, or even when all we had time for was to have a quick chat in the hallway. Han always took the time to listen and give a thoughful answer, but never missing out on getting a laugh in as well.

Han, my friend, you will be dearly missed. Rest in peace.

I had the privilege of working with Han as part of SIG Instrumentation for several years, beginning in the shadow phase and continuing well beyond, during which time I was fortunate to learn under his mentorship. Although I never had the chance to meet him in person, the time we spent working together left a lasting impression on me. Han approached problems with a rare originality that was deeply inspiring. He was a remarkable mentor not because he taught me what to fix, but because he showed me how to think. Our hour-long one-on-ones often spanned the many facets of the SIG, and I would leave each conversation with pages of notes and action items across projects, subprojects, and even side projects, like [mad](https://github.com/rexagod/mad), whose name I vividly remember us chuckling at. While most of our discussions centered on Kubernetes, every so often we would drift into conversations about life itself. Those moments always left me more inspired, more determined, and more grateful than before. To me, Han was not just a teacher or mentor, but a role model. His accomplishments continue to amaze me, but what I value most is the confidence and guidance he gave me. I feel incredibly fortunate that our paths crossed. Han shaped my journey in ways I will never forget, and SIG Instrumentation will not be the same without him.

Rest in peace, Han.

I was so sad when I heard that Han Kang, my friend, passed away.

I first knew Han in 2019. It was because of his proposal called `Kubernetes Control-Plane Metrics Stability`. The proposal 
was perfect, so I decided to help make it come true. When we worked on this proposal, Han gave me a lot of encouragement 
and help. He shared some principles with me, and I still remember them now. For example, one principle about instrumentation
is: it must not affect the program’s function and stability.

We worked happily together in SIG Instrumentation. I even encouraged him to be the chair of SIG Instrumentation. Because 
I thought his talent was good enough for this role. Most of the time, Han and I talked on Slack or in Zoom meetings. 
Besides work, he also told me interesting things about his life. For example, during the pandemic, he was always brave 
to go out with his family. I was lucky to meet him face to face at KubeCon EU 2024 in Paris. He was still so funny and 
humorous. What surprised me was that he still cared about my work. He even gave me valuable advice on my projects.

The last time I talked to Han was in July 2025, on LinkedIn. He said he had joined a new company. At the same time, 
he encouraged me and praised me again. But it’s a pity—after that short chat, I never thought it would be our forever goodbye.
To me, Han was not only a friend but also a good teacher. Getting the news of his death suddenly makes me very, very sad. 

Rest in peace, Han. I will miss you forever.

Han was my coworker, and then my friend. It has been more than a week and I still don't have words to say what he meant.

Han and I had very similar upbringings and life history. It is hard to be more specific than that in public.

Han really liked Lu Cixin and lent me a book of his short stories to read. I recommended "worm", an online serial and
warned him it was "long". Weeks later Han gave me a bunch of friendly ribbing because my definition of "long" was a
million plus words. I was very surprised he read it so fast.

Han was smart. I remember eating lunch with him, discussing covid cases the Friday before the pandemic panic really took
off in the US. I worked from home the following monday, but he moved his retirement account to cash from his phone that
Friday at lunch. (But did he rebuy at the right time? Ah that I don't know. Few did.)

We talked over a lot of designs when we worked together, kubecon talks, etc. Han had so much energy for accomplishing
things, no one could match it. Energy and good taste about where to spend it, a rare combination.

I moved away from the bay area, but Han came to visit. He brought my kids some legos. I cooked, we sampled my whiskey
collection even though neither of us drank that much any more. I regret not making an equivalent trip.

He knew I'd taken up a bit of woodworking, and one thing led to another and I made him a desk top. I traded messages
with him on Sunday when the courier picked it up from my shop. But Han was gone before the delivery on Tuesday. I still
can't believe it.

This tribute is inadequate, but I don't know how to do better. I'm still not willing to say goodbye. His was not an
appropriate age to depart. Maybe someday signal will fill in the checkmarks on the last messages I wrote to him and
we can have a laugh about what a scare I had.

Until then, rest in peace, Han.

Han was such an incredible engineer and a wonderful soul. I was shocked and dismayed to hear he had passed suddenly.

I was lucky to work with Han in his time at Google, where he was an excellent technical lead.
When I first transferred to the team, Han was exactly the sort of person I was excited to work with more closely.
Han was smart, funny, kind, and thoughtful. 

He was a mentor and a leader in the Kubernetes community, who brought a spark to every conversation with a twinkle in his eye.

In this community we're lucky to meet and work with a lot of incredibly talented people, among them all I held Han in very high regard.

Han put so much thought and energy into everything, yet he was always willing to chat and give advice.
I really appreciate how much time he spent mentoring those around us, and I think he will be forever remembered for this and his good humor.

When Han let us know he was leaving for another role, my gut reaction was dissapointment, but he seemed truly excited.

Later he began to be more active again in the Kubernetes project, and we got back in touch, just a few weeks ago.
The last time I spoke to Han was only the week before in the Kubernetes Slack following a project meeting.
Han seemed so happy and energetic, I was really looking forward to working together again through open source.
We had been chatting about how things had changed, how he was doing, and where things were headed. I expected
to continue that conversation in the coming weeks.
I couldn't beleive he was gone so suddenly.

I wish I'd gotten to know Han better personally, I looked up to and admired him and he was just a pleasure to be around.

Han, you will be missed. Rest in peace.

I first met Han when I was still interviewing with Google and was being team matched. I remember him being so easy to talk to, he asked about what I was working on and we discussed some challenges with my ongoing work, for which he even offered some helpful tips.  I'm so glad I chose that team. Back then, my rationale was the chance to work on Kubernetes and gain open-source experience. But now I know the best part was working with Han for over two years.

Han was there for me since my day one at Google - from helping with trivial tasks like sorting out permissions issues to setting me up for my first open source PR. His enthusiasm for open source was infectious. Gradually he went from advising me about my code to guiding me about my career. He taught me how to think like a good engineer - how there will always be problems to fix but how to identify the right problems to solve, how to always think about the end user and what they expect from a feature/functionality, how to always push for the right thing even when there were conflicts. In our 1:1s, he would always point me to interesting problems to solve or things to read - some technical, others philosophical. These discussions continued even after he left Google, and I was just so amazed by his consideration for the people he knew. He really cared. And he showed that not just with his words but also his actions. 

Han was the rock for all my troubles. He was the person who "opened all the doors" for me. I was devastated to hear the news of him leaving Google and it was hard to imagine the team without Han. After he left, we still stayed in touch but it took some time for me to get used to not seeing him around. I think I was still coping with that when this tragic news dropped a week ago. Even today, I can't believe that he is no longer with us. Before this, whenever I would miss him, I would always imagine him being stellar at whatever he was doing, solving hard problems, sharing countless interesting ideas, having empathetic conversations and having fun while doing so. Now, I will always remember him that way.  

I will forever remember his smile and his thoughtful expression as he listened so sincerely to whatever I had to say. I will also remember his big hug in Salt Lake City— our last in-person meeting, right before he left Google. I will forever miss you Han, and I don't have the words to thank you enough for your unwavering support, guidance, laughter, and all the incredible memories. Rest in peace.

I met Han through SIG Instrumentation and Han was one of the reasons I enjoyed contributing to the SIG. His leadership and positive attitude contributed to a great community.  When I changed employers and moved to Google, Han was again supportive which helped with my transition to a new company.  Knowing there was another great engineer and friendly face made the company seem less like a big unknown.  My condolences to the family, and I'll look forward to meeting up some day after this life.

## Jago Macleod

I'm so grateful for having known Han; he made me a much better teammate, leader, friend, and person. And it wasn't just me - Han made everyone around him better. His enthusiasm was infectious, and he inspired those around him. He also happened to also be an incredible engineer. 

Han was an amazing person to work with and around. He set out to do the right thing and found a way to do it. He found the quietest and simplest way to solve a problem with most impact and the least drama. He found ways to be overly certain to share credit and to inspire newcomers to get more involved. And he was incredibly generous with his time, always going the extra mile to lift the team around him. 

Han didn't get along with everyone always, but when he disagreed it was from a place of loyalty to ideals. And while often ready to debate a point, he was generally open to changing his perspective. He was also fiercely loyal to people - to his team and his community and his family, found or otherwise. 

I still can't believe Han is gone. I am heart-broken and the only consolation is that I'm not alone in that feeling, and that I know Han inspired so many of us through his excellence, his actions, and his empathy. 

Thank you Han for setting an example and for raising the bar - we'll aspire to meet it. 

## Federico Bongiovanni

My dear Han, I've been repeating over the last 3 weeks that I was going to sit down and write something here when I am ready to write about you, and not write about me. And yet, as you can see my first sentence is about me and how hard has been to process and accept the news. Maybe that day will never come. We are all grieving, and there may never be a good time to write. So I'll write about you. 

Because you, Han, you man, you were the light of the show. 

First, how bright you were. And how kind you were with those of us that were not that bright. You had deep, long term, visionary ideas. But you also knew that people like me could not see that far. So you had this incredible patience and contagious enthusiasm, to explain things in a way that could make everybody see them, and get aligned. Who would not get aligned if most of your ideas were brillant? It was a mather of taking the work and time to talk to people, and you were so good at that. 

I remember that every time you were coming to me to tell me a plan, I was always expecting the second part that comes after the sales pitch, where you would explain me the problems. But usually that part never came. "No, I already took care of it. I spoke with the people involved, I already fixed it, look at this", and you would show me what you did (when?) and explain it to me. Dude, where did all that energy came from? Where was the endless source? you would explain it a thousand times to a thousand people, and always with that enthusiasm and energy, like it was the first time. It was no surprise that people would follow you. 

Second, how generous you were with your brighness. Almost a powerhouse, a bottomless factory of ideas, that you gave to people for free, opening doors and opportunities all around you. There is a testament of people whose life you have touched and changed. People who will always be better because of you. Who will honor your memory, remembering something you told them or taught them. At work and in life: because you didn't care about the lines, you blended them together.

Indeed, you didn't care about lines and roles. You became my friend. You helped me to grow. You told me hard truths about myself. But most of the time you told me nice things. You gifted me with your friendship. After I met you, it didn't take a lot of time for me to trust you almost blindly. How could I not? And yet, you thanked me many times for my trust, in your humbleness, not understanding that there was nothing to thank, you earned it with remarks. Summa cum laude.

Third, I know that your two daughters, Alisa and Mari, were your entire world. We spoke about our daughters and our role as parents until exhaustion! I tried to scare you about the upcoming teenage years. You tried to pretend you knew what you were going to do. And we played that game so many times. And through all of it, always your heart poured on every statement about them, and I would like your kids to know that they were undisputably the most important thing in your life -by years light- compared to anything else. And it filled my heart with joy everytime you showed me a picture of them, or your told me something about them. Maybe because I was always worried that you worked too much, and I knew they would bring you back to the ground. The light in your eyes would change when your kids would appear. I hope they have enough memories of me. And I'm here also to tell them a lot more about their dad when they grow older.

Finally, "Give me an army of Hans and I'll conquer the world", many people heard me through the years saying that. I didn't carve that phrase after your passed, I started saying that after some months of working together. I never took it back. And I feel becomes even more true now that I've learned from many of your loved ones more great stories about you. You were a prolific bright mind, who made large lasting changes to everything you touched, including upstream Kubernetes and to GKE, expanding beyond the boundaries of companies and organizations. 

I miss you a lot. Will always miss you. I still talk to you. And I know that my relationship with you did not end, it changed -sadly- and I'll learn how to accept that. I still talk to you sometimes. I hope your sould rests in peace my friend.

Thank you for everything.
