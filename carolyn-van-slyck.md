Carolyn was the kindest person that I have had the pleasure of knowing. We started working together in 2017 and I immediately realized how fortunate I was to be able to work with her. She was generous with both her time and knowledge, and she cared deeply about the people and communities she was involved in. She always worked to build up the people around her and to identify opportunities for all and worked toward healthy and inclusive communities. We worked on a number of things together, but starting the [Porter](https://porter.sh) project with her is one of the highlights of my career. Watching her welcome and guide new contributors was so inspiring. Her dedication to the community, especially through her service on the Kubernetes Code of Conduct committee and her contributions to TAG Contributor Strategy deserve to be honored. 

Carolyn was an amazing friend, both at work and outside. 2020 was a really tough year for me personally and Carolyn was always there to check in on me and play Animal Crossing. Her friendship meant a great deal to me and I'll miss her very much. 

Rest in peace, Carolyn. 🌈 ✨

Carolyn was a great friend and colleague and will be dearly missed. Carolyn's dedication to the open source community was inspiring. She worked tirelessly to make sure that everyone felt welcome and included. Simply put, we have Carolyn to thank for open source communities being as inclusive and welcoming to contributors as they are today. I have no doubt that her legacy will live on through cloud native projects and communities. It's been my honor to work alongside Carolyn; she was one of the best engineers I've ever had the opportunity to work with. Her technical acumen, dedication to process, and thoroughness were things that I always admired about her and am thankful that I was able to be part of. She was always willing to help out and was a great mentor to many. I will miss her dearly. My thoughts are with her family and friends through this difficult season.

Carolyn and I were on the same team during the worst of the covid pandemic. Mid-lockdown, we were all emotionally spent. Carolyn worked hard to create an online environment of support for the team. She was quick to be there for her teammates (including me) even when she was herself drained and dispirited. We chatted about favorite ramen at our team virtual lunch. She whooped everyone during team trivia. And she modeled and invited vulnerability as the team walked the covid path together.

Carolyn was an exceptional engineer. I have often told the story of how she came up with the idea for Porter in the middle of a team offsite. While the rest of us were all going down another path, she hit a moment of insight and shared it. It was brilliant. And we pivoted. Carolyn also displayed a profound passion for community. While she built more than a few successful ones, her real passion was making community building into a repeatable practice.

Thank you, Carolyn, for all you did for me, for your team, and for the community.

Carolyn is the best human I know; for me that present tense will last a long time. I met her when she was on another team working on svcat; -- a way of binding cloud services into a cluster as a crd in a coordinated way that didn't quite hit the sweet spot for one reason or another -- and her passion for making it easy to do the simple thing was acres beyond anyone I'd ever met. She'd ask me what I'd done, and why, and what was I thinking, and then she'd change it that night with an insight into what my mind wanted to do but with a modification that wasn't "for me" -- it included intuitive obviousness for others to one side of my brainspace or the other.

Later, she joined the team I work with more directly. What I discovered was a caring, intelligent person who believed not that "I" as a dev or PM should be able to use these tools; she cared that anyone, literally anyone at all with the motivation could use those tools. And even more, she cared that anyone could enter the tool community and learn how to use and build and contribute and even just chat about the tools. Carolyn wasn't a gifted ux person for software; she was a gifted ux person for people. I used to think I was the most open-minded, welcoming person to new tools, new ecosystems -- the user is always right!

No, I discovered, that wasn't enough. For her, the good-faith humans are always right. And that approach extended to every conversation I eventually had with her, about the world, this crap we call living, family, friends, you name it. I will carry Carolyn with me everywhere I go, because she fundamentally changed who I am for the better by being the model she was. It's hard to bear her loss. I sure I'm one of many.

Thank you for the time you spent with me Carolyn. For the encouragement and support. For speaking up for those around you. For helping me through complicated times. For your compassion and your strength. For your intellect, your enthusiasm and your energy. I learned so much from you that I carry with me still. I hate that I am typing this and I'm sorry you were taken too soon.

Carolyn named the Porter logo after me. She sent me a link to the website one day out of the blue and on it was a whole paragraph about me. I was floored. She encouraged and supported me in public and in private. She was there for me during multiple uncomfortable situations. She had a great ear and gave sound, balanced advice. She was a sweet and kind person. She was funny and incredibly intelligent and generous. I am grateful I got to know her and work with her.

Rest in peace Carolyn.
