Carolyn was the kindest person that I have had the pleasure of knowing. We started working together in 2017 and I immediately realized how fortunate I was to be able to work with her. She was generous with both her time and knowledge, and she cared deeply about the people and communities she was involved in. She always worked to build up the people around her and to identify opportunities for all and worked toward healthy and inclusive communities. We worked on a number of things together, but starting the [Porter](https://porter.sh) project with her is one of the highlights of my career. Watching her welcome and guide new contributors was so inspiring. Her dedication to the community, especially through her service on the Kubernetes Code of Conduct committee and her contributions to TAG Contributor Strategy deserve to be honored. 

Carolyn was an amazing friend, both at work and outside. 2020 was a really tough year for me personally and Carolyn was always there to check in on me and play Animal Crossing. Her friendship meant a great deal to me and I'll miss her very much. 

Rest in peace, Carolyn. 🌈 ✨

Carolyn was a great friend and colleague and will be dearly missed. Carolyn's dedication to the open source community was inspiring. She worked tirelessly to make sure that everyone felt welcome and included. Simply put, we have Carolyn to thank for open source communities being as inclusive and welcoming to contributors as they are today. I have no doubt that her legacy will live on through cloud native projects and communities. It's been my honor to work alongside Carolyn; she was one of the best engineers I've ever had the opportunity to work with. Her technical acumen, dedication to process, and thoroughness were things that I always admired about her and am thankful that I was able to be part of. She was always willing to help out and was a great mentor to many. I will miss her dearly. My thoughts are with her family and friends through this difficult season.

Carolyn and I were on the same team during the worst of the covid pandemic. Mid-lockdown, we were all emotionally spent. Carolyn worked hard to create an online environment of support for the team. She was quick to be there for her teammates (including me) even when she was herself drained and dispirited. We chatted about favorite ramen at our team virtual lunch. She whooped everyone during team trivia. And she modeled and invited vulnerability as the team walked the covid path together.

Carolyn was an exceptional engineer. I have often told the story of how she came up with the idea for Porter in the middle of a team offsite. While the rest of us were all going down another path, she hit a moment of insight and shared it. It was brilliant. And we pivoted. Carolyn also displayed a profound passion for community. While she built more than a few successful ones, her real passion was making community building into a repeatable practice.

Thank you, Carolyn, for all you did for me, for your team, and for the community.

Carolyn is the best human I know; for me that present tense will last a long time. I met her when she was on another team working on svcat; -- a way of binding cloud services into a cluster as a crd in a coordinated way that didn't quite hit the sweet spot for one reason or another -- and her passion for making it easy to do the simple thing was acres beyond anyone I'd ever met. She'd ask me what I'd done, and why, and what was I thinking, and then she'd change it that night with an insight into what my mind wanted to do but with a modification that wasn't "for me" -- it included intuitive obviousness for others to one side of my brainspace or the other.

Later, she joined the team I work with more directly. What I discovered was a caring, intelligent person who believed not that "I" as a dev or PM should be able to use these tools; she cared that anyone, literally anyone at all with the motivation could use those tools. And even more, she cared that anyone could enter the tool community and learn how to use and build and contribute and even just chat about the tools. Carolyn wasn't a gifted ux person for software; she was a gifted ux person for people. I used to think I was the most open-minded, welcoming person to new tools, new ecosystems -- the user is always right!

No, I discovered, that wasn't enough. For her, the good-faith humans are always right. And that approach extended to every conversation I eventually had with her, about the world, this crap we call living, family, friends, you name it. I will carry Carolyn with me everywhere I go, because she fundamentally changed who I am for the better by being the model she was. It's hard to bear her loss. I sure I'm one of many.

Carolyn was a great friend and mentor. We started working as a team since 2022 during the pandemic. She was always there to cheer up the team and share her happiness with us. Her care and support for the open source communities were inspiring, especially her dedication to create an inclusive and open environment for everyone. I still wear the Gopher shirt that I ordered online from Women Who Go which she ran. I watched many of her talks at CNCF on YouTube and they were all great and taught me a lot on public speaking. I enjoyed every minute of the casual and non-work related talk with Carolyn on the Faces meetings. Carolyn helped me to understand how community meeting works, how to write a great proposal for talks, and how to become a caring and supportive community member. More importantly, she taught me how to be a better version of myself.

I will miss her dearly. Rest in peace, Carolyn.

## Sarah Corleissen

When I think of the Cloud Native community, I think of Carolyn. She was incredibly kind, and also quite funny. She was a tireless cheerleader for good documentation and for women in computing. Her impact will make a difference for years to come. We are all the poorer for her loss, and the richer for having known her. Carolyn, may you rest in peace and rise in glory.

## Michelle Dhanani

Thank you for the time you spent with me Carolyn. For the encouragement and support. For speaking up for those around you. For helping me through complicated times. For your compassion and your strength. For your intellect, your enthusiasm and your energy. I learned so much from you that I carry with me still. I hate that I am typing this and I'm sorry you were taken too soon.

Carolyn named the Porter logo after me. She sent me a link to the website one day out of the blue and on it was a whole paragraph about me. I was floored. She encouraged and supported me in public and in private. She was there for me during multiple uncomfortable situations. She had a great ear and gave sound, balanced advice. She was a sweet and kind person. She was funny and incredibly intelligent and generous. I am grateful I got to know her and work with her.

Rest in peace Carolyn.

## Josh Gavant

I just talked with Carolyn a couple weeks ago about building the Chicago cloud community - I suppose that's a fitting ending with someone that was always committed to supporting others. She was a consistent, helpful partner when we introduced Go on Azure. Her commitment to helping others and supporting the broader community inspired and taught me a lot. She will be missed.

## Josh Berkus

I first met Carolyn at GopherCon, where she helped make me feel welcome in the Go community.  And that's what she did for many, many others for the years afterwards: make people feel welcome. From helping create TAG-CS Contributor Growth WG, her work in Kubernetes, and building an exemplary contributor infrastructure for Porter, she was all about helping other people make their best contributions.  I'm going to miss her; her ideas, her relentless optimism, her presence, her fun conversation.

## Paris Pittman

Carolyn had a heart of gold and kindness that was on another level. It shined through her work on Porter, Kubernetes SIG Service Catalog, TAG Contributor Strategy, and bootstrapping the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee. We first met while she was working with the SIG Service Catalog group and asked me for advice on growing their contributor base and attracting new contributors. I knew then that I had an advocate and future friend. Same team, same mission. As the years grew, I asked Carolyn along to most things I got into that had a mission of contributor strategy and community growth. Anytime I needed a "plus one" or a co-leader, Carolyn was there for both. Even if I left the project like retirement from Chairing TAG Contributor Strategy, I knew she was part of the strong leadership team and trusted that she would rise to the occassion. She did so gloriously and in ways I didn't even imagine.

We had some deep personal and professional conversations over the years that I will cherish forever. I love open source because of people like Carolyn. I will never stop advocating for the maintainer; Carolyn didn't intend to stop either. I'm still in disblief that I'm typing this. She was far too young and just not done yet. In honor of Carolyn, lets all take care of each other, be kinder to the newcomer in open source, mentor people around us, and write those docs. So much love, Carolyn <3

## Chris Aniszczyk

Carolyn was a tour de force when it came to welcoming new folks in the cloud native community on top of being a strong project maintainer awarded for her amazing efforts. Her work in growing TAG Contributor Strategy is something I deeply admired and reflects the best of the cloud native community in my opinion. I always appreciated conversations with her she will be missed dearly.

## Rita Zhang

Carolyn embodied what an open source community should be. She was always kind and welcoming no matter who you are. I met her years ago when she was working on the service catalog and she welcomed new contributors like myself to OSBA. I learned alot from her. It was then she introduced me to [Women Who Go](https://womenwhogo.org/) and other open source community initiatives she was deeply involved with. She really cared about the developer experience and her work reflects that. She always made an effort to make sure the solution is easy to use both for new contributors and end users. She was also a great speaker giving talks at GopherCon, KubeCon, FOSDEM and more. I will miss geeking out with her.
  
We will miss you, Carolyn.


## Feynman Zhou

Carolyn always advocate OSS community culture and cloud native community events to the world. She is enthusiastic about his work in the OSS community. She helped Porter and other cloud native projects become inclusive and welcoming to contributors as they are today. Carolyn was an inspiration to others, and her memory will continue to inspire those who knew her. 


## Chris Lentricchia

I was just reviewing some reimbursed reciepts from you yesterday while filing Operation Dvoretskyi's taxes, so I'm not quite sure what to say right now. This all a bit sudden, so I guess I'll keep it brief: I didn't know you that well beyond Operation Dvoretskyi's business. If someone asked me what your favorite food - or color - was, I'd have no idea. I've been guilty of not stopping to smell the roses, so maybe that's my fault. What I do know is that you helped us out of the kindness of your heart, and that speaks to your character and told me all I really needed to know. I think everyone meets their judgement day in some form, where they're reminded of the good they did in the world, or the hurt they've caused to others. You helped a lot of people - some that that you'd never even met yourself - I have about $800.00 in Windows 11 licenses that you bought with your employee discount to prove it. I hope you were reminded of that. Thanks for being there, Carolyn.


## Brendan Burns

I enjoyed every single interaction I ever had with Carolyn. She was endlessly enthusiastic, friendly and interested in both technical problems and the best way
to build things that others would find useful. In other words the ideal member of a team and of the broader open source community. I've known here from the
early days of service catalog all the way through her recent work on Porter and CNAB. I'm grateful for all of her contributions to cloud native and open source
on Azure. You will be missed.

## Josh Dolitsky

Carolyn deeply understood the importance of "how" we do things. The news of her passing affected me not because she was a great developer (which she was), but because her approach to software was people-oriented, enthusiastic, and compassionate. This community has suffered a great loss. Thank you Carolyn for showing us the way things could and should be. May we honor you by following your lead.

## Maartje Eyskens

I just now realized how much of a privilege it was to call Carolyn a friend.... She was an amazing person who despite everything continued to bring wholesomeness to our community in her work in many communities. She had a dedicated drive to make open source a truly open and welcoming space for everyone involved.

She was a true leader of Women Who Go where she was there to support everybody in every way. From proposing an awesome emoji set to getting financial support for setting up a chapter she did it all. A driving force that will be greatly missed…

We will all miss you very much Carolyn 🌈🦄✨.

## Celeste Horgan 

Carolyn always had time to welcome people to the CNCF community and teach them the ropes. She was the consummate contributor's contributor and passionate about building onramps to open source for anyone who wanted to contribute. Carolyn took on the hard work of community building and did it with aplomb.

It was wonderful bonding with you over cute CNCF project logos (Porter is still, objectively, the cutest), community work, and everything in between. Your presence influenced how I contribute to open source. You will be missed. 

## Radu Matei

Carolyn was brilliant, kind, and an incredible engineer. I had the privilege and joy of working with her on the same team for a few years, and that had a profound impact on me. Fostering welcoming and inclusive communities and focusing on building an amazing UX are two things Carolyn always prioritized, and was always happy to help, mentor, and spend time helping people.

Whether it was talking about our favorite dumplings and ramen, or trying to solve difficult engineering problems, she was always there to help, uplift, and make things better.

You will be missed, Carolyn. ✨

## Catherine Paganini

Carolyn was an active and beloved member of our community. Dedicated and hardworking, she was always willing to lend a helping hand. Her commitment to providing open source projects with the tools they need to succeed played a crucial role in developing the TAG-CS Contributor Growth Working Group. Despite her many accomplishments, Carolyn remained humble and always eager to share her experiences and lessons learned with others. She was a wonderful human being, and her passing is a great loss to the entire community. We will greatly miss her 💔
