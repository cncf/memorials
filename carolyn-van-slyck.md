# In Memory of Carolyn Van Slyck

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Carolyn and what she meant to us in one place. Please add your contribution below via a pull request. 

## Jeremy Rickard

Carolyn was the kindest person that I have had the pleasure of knowing. We started working together in 2017 and I immediately realized how fortunate I was to be able to work with her. She was generous with both her time and knowledge, and she cared deeply about the people and communities she was involved in. She always worked to build up the people around her and to identify opportunities for all and worked toward healthy and inclusive communities. We worked on a number of things together, but starting the [Porter](https://porter.sh) project with her is one of the highlights of my career. Watching her welcome and guide new contributors was so inspiring. Her dedication to the community, especially through her service on the Kubernetes Code of Conduct committee and her contributions to TAG Contributor Strategy deserve to be honored. 

Carolyn was an amazing friend, both at work and outside. 2020 was a really tough year for me personally and Carolyn was always there to check in on me and play Animal Crossing. Her friendship meant a great deal to me and I'll miss her very much. 

Rest in peace, Carolyn. 🌈 ✨

## Lachlan Evenson

Carolyn was a great friend and colleague and will be dearly missed. Carolyn's dedication to the open source community was inspiring. She worked tirelessly to make sure that everyone felt welcome and included. Simply put, we have Carolyn to thank for open source communities being as inclusive and welcoming to contributors as they are today. I have no doubt that her legacy will live on through cloud native projects and communities. It's been my honor to work alongside Carolyn; she was one of the best engineers I've ever had the opportunity to work with. Her technical acumen, dedication to process, and thoroughness were things that I always admired about her and am thankful that I was able to be part of. She was always willing to help out and was a great mentor to many. I will miss her dearly. My thoughts are with her family and friends through this difficult season.

## Matt Butcher

Carolyn and I were on the same team during the worst of the covid pandemic. Mid-lockdown, we were all emotionally spent. Carolyn worked hard to create an online environment of support for the team. She was quick to be there for her teammates (including me) even when she was herself drained and dispirited. We chatted about favorite ramen at our team virtual lunch. She whooped everyone during team trivia. And she modeled and invited vulnerability as the team walked the covid path together.

Carolyn was an exceptional engineer. I have often told the story of how she came up with the idea for Porter in the middle of a team offsite. While the rest of us were all going down another path, she hit a moment of insight and shared it. It was brilliant. And we pivoted. Carolyn also displayed a profound passion for community. While she built more than a few successful ones, her real passion was making community building into a repeatable practice.

Thank you, Carolyn, for all you did for me, for your team, and for the community.

## Ralph Squillace

Carolyn is the best human I know; for me that present tense will last a long time. I met her when she was on another team working on svcat; -- a way of binding cloud services into a cluster as a crd in a coordinated way that didn't quite hit the sweet spot for one reason or another -- and her passion for making it easy to do the simple thing was acres beyond anyone I'd ever met. She'd ask me what I'd done, and why, and what was I thinking, and then she'd change it that night with an insight into what my mind wanted to do but with a modification that wasn't "for me" -- it included intuitive obviousness for others to one side of my brainspace or the other.

Later, she joined the team I work with more directly. What I discovered was a caring, intelligent person who believed not that "I" as a dev or PM should be able to use these tools; she cared that anyone, literally anyone at all with the motivation could use those tools. And even more, she cared that anyone could enter the tool community and learn how to use and build and contribute and even just chat about the tools. Carolyn wasn't a gifted ux person for software; she was a gifted ux person for people. I used to think I was the most open-minded, welcoming person to new tools, new ecosystems -- the user is always right!

No, I discovered, that wasn't enough. For her, the good-faith humans are always right. And that approach extended to every conversation I eventually had with her, about the world, this crap we call living, family, friends, you name it. I will carry Carolyn with me everywhere I go, because she fundamentally changed who I am for the better by being the model she was. It's hard to bear her loss. I sure I'm one of many.

## Jiaxiao (Joe) Zhou

Carolyn was a great friend and mentor. We started working as a team since 2022 during the pandemic. She was always there to cheer up the team and share her happiness with us. Her care and support for the open source communities were inspiring, especially her dedication to create an inclusive and open environment for everyone. I still wear the Gopher shirt that I ordered online from Women Who Go which she ran. I watched many of her talks at CNCF on YouTube and they were all great and taught me a lot on public speaking. I enjoyed every minute of the casual and non-work related talk with Carolyn on the Faces meetings. Carolyn helped me to understand how community meeting works, how to write a great proposal for talks, and how to become a caring and supportive community member. More importantly, she taught me how to be a better version of myself.

I will miss her dearly. Rest in peace, Carolyn.

## Sarah Corleissen

When I think of the Cloud Native community, I think of Carolyn. She was incredibly kind, and also quite funny. She was a tireless cheerleader for good documentation and for women in computing. Her impact will make a difference for years to come. We are all the poorer for her loss, and the richer for having known her. Carolyn, may you rest in peace and rise in glory.

## Michelle Dhanani

Thank you for the time you spent with me Carolyn. For the encouragement and support. For speaking up for those around you. For helping me through complicated times. For your compassion and your strength. For your intellect, your enthusiasm and your energy. I learned so much from you that I carry with me still. I hate that I am typing this and I'm sorry you were taken too soon.

Carolyn named the Porter logo after me. She sent me a link to the website one day out of the blue and on it was a whole paragraph about me. I was floored. She encouraged and supported me in public and in private. She was there for me during multiple uncomfortable situations. She had a great ear and gave sound, balanced advice. She was a sweet and kind person. She was funny and incredibly intelligent and generous. I am grateful I got to know her and work with her.

Rest in peace Carolyn.

## Josh Gavant

I just talked with Carolyn a couple weeks ago about building the Chicago cloud community - I suppose that's a fitting ending with someone that was always committed to supporting others. She was a consistent, helpful partner when we introduced Go on Azure. Her commitment to helping others and supporting the broader community inspired and taught me a lot. She will be missed.

## Josh Berkus

I first met Carolyn at GopherCon, where she helped make me feel welcome in the Go community.  And that's what she did for many, many others for the years afterwards: make people feel welcome. From helping create TAG-CS Contributor Growth WG, her work in Kubernetes, and building an exemplary contributor infrastructure for Porter, she was all about helping other people make their best contributions.  I'm going to miss her; her ideas, her relentless optimism, her presence, her fun conversation.

## Paris Pittman

Carolyn had a heart of gold and kindness that was on another level. It shined through her work on Porter, Kubernetes SIG Service Catalog, TAG Contributor Strategy, and bootstrapping the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee. We first met while she was working with the SIG Service Catalog group and asked me for advice on growing their contributor base and attracting new contributors. I knew then that I had an advocate and future friend. Same team, same mission. As the years grew, I asked Carolyn along to most things I got into that had a mission of contributor strategy and community growth. Anytime I needed a "plus one" or a co-leader, Carolyn was there for both. Even if I left the project like retirement from Chairing TAG Contributor Strategy, I knew she was part of the strong leadership team and trusted that she would rise to the occassion. She did so gloriously and in ways I didn't even imagine.

We had some deep personal and professional conversations over the years that I will cherish forever. I love open source because of people like Carolyn. I will never stop advocating for the maintainer; Carolyn didn't intend to stop either. I'm still in disblief that I'm typing this. She was far too young and just not done yet. In honor of Carolyn, lets all take care of each other, be kinder to the newcomer in open source, mentor people around us, and write those docs. So much love, Carolyn <3

## Chris Aniszczyk

Carolyn was a tour de force when it came to welcoming new folks in the cloud native community on top of being a strong project maintainer awarded for her amazing efforts. Her work in growing TAG Contributor Strategy is something I deeply admired and reflects the best of the cloud native community in my opinion. I always appreciated conversations with her she will be missed dearly.

## Rita Zhang

Carolyn embodied what an open source community should be. She was always kind and welcoming no matter who you are. I met her years ago when she was working on the service catalog and she welcomed new contributors like myself to OSBA. I learned alot from her. It was then she introduced me to [Women Who Go](https://womenwhogo.org/) and other open source community initiatives she was deeply involved with. She really cared about the developer experience and her work reflects that. She always made an effort to make sure the solution is easy to use both for new contributors and end users. She was also a great speaker giving talks at GopherCon, KubeCon, FOSDEM and more. I will miss geeking out with her.
  
We will miss you, Carolyn.

## Nick Eberts

I met Carolyn when she came over to Microsoft in 2017. We quickly bonded when I noticed that she named her NUC kubernetes nodes after My Little Pony characters and I told her about my kids shared obsession. Anytime we talked she would ask about them. Carolyn was always the kindest soul on any call we were on and ALWAYS took the time to mentor me when I needed some help. She didn't care that you knew how great an engineer she was and she was a great engineer. It is a sad day. :(

## Feynman Zhou

Carolyn always advocate OSS community culture and cloud native community events to the world. She is enthusiastic about his work in the OSS community. She helped Porter and other cloud native projects become inclusive and welcoming to contributors as they are today. Carolyn was an inspiration to others, and her memory will continue to inspire those who knew her. 


## Chris Lentricchia

I was just reviewing some reimbursed reciepts from you yesterday while filing Operation Dvoretskyi's taxes, so I'm not quite sure what to say right now. This all a bit sudden, so I guess I'll keep it brief: I didn't know you that well beyond Operation Dvoretskyi's business. If someone asked me what your favorite food - or color - was, I'd have no idea. I've been guilty of not stopping to smell the roses, so maybe that's my fault. What I do know is that you helped us out of the kindness of your heart, and that speaks to your character and told me all I really needed to know. I think everyone meets their judgement day in some form, where they're reminded of the good they did in the world, or the hurt they've caused to others. You helped a lot of people - some that that you'd never even met yourself - I have about $800.00 in Windows 11 licenses that you bought with your employee discount to prove it. I hope you were reminded of that. Thanks for being there, Carolyn.


## Brendan Burns

I enjoyed every single interaction I ever had with Carolyn. She was endlessly enthusiastic, friendly and interested in both technical problems and the best way
to build things that others would find useful. In other words the ideal member of a team and of the broader open source community. I've known here from the
early days of service catalog all the way through her recent work on Porter and CNAB. I'm grateful for all of her contributions to cloud native and open source
on Azure. You will be missed.

## Josh Dolitsky

Carolyn deeply understood the importance of "how" we do things. The news of her passing affected me not because she was a great developer (which she was), but because her approach to software was people-oriented, enthusiastic, and compassionate. This community has suffered a great loss. Thank you Carolyn for showing us the way things could and should be. May we honor you by following your lead.

## Madhav Jivrajani

I had the chance to work with Carolyn in the Go community where she went out of her way to help folks get started, check in with folks on how they're doing and ensure that people felt like they were equipped and empowered to do things like write up talk proposals, give talks and share experiences. I feel fortunate to have worked with someone like her, who truly emobodied the open source and community spirit. I hope we can follow in her footsteps.

## Maartje Eyskens

I just now realized how much of a privilege it was to call Carolyn a friend.... She was an amazing person who despite everything continued to bring wholesomeness to our community in her work in many communities. She had a dedicated drive to make open source a truly open and welcoming space for everyone involved.

She was a true leader of Women Who Go where she was there to support everybody in every way. From proposing an awesome emoji set to getting financial support for setting up a chapter she did it all. A driving force that will be greatly missed…

We will all miss you very much Carolyn 🌈🦄✨.

## Carmen Andoh

Carolyn so deeply cared about every single community she was in. She brought empathy, inclusivity, and access to an open source ecosystem that needed it. A true heart of gold. 

A little known fact about Carolyn: she would spend her own money helping many people to travel to and attend Go conferences who would otherwise not be able to afford it. Many of the individuals she silently sponsored were able to get access to opportunities as a result. She also didn't want to be publicly commended for this, at it was just her way.  I commend her now, and will endeavor to honor her memory by embodying that same spirit of generosity and selflessness. 

Thank you Carolyn. You will be missed. 💛💛💛  

## Alex Jones

My interactions with Carolyn were only just starting and I admired her activities within the community in so many ways. I felt inspired by her drive to make the community a better place and her ability to bring people together. 

Thank you for everything, you will be missed.

## Celeste Horgan 

Carolyn always had time to welcome people to the CNCF community and teach them the ropes. She was the consummate contributor's contributor and passionate about building onramps to open source for anyone who wanted to contribute. Carolyn took on the hard work of community building and did it with aplomb.

It was wonderful bonding with you over cute CNCF project logos (Porter is still, objectively, the cutest), community work, and everything in between. Your presence influenced how I contribute to open source. You will be missed. 

## Radu Matei

Carolyn was brilliant, kind, and an incredible engineer. I had the privilege and joy of working with her on the same team for a few years, and that had a profound impact on me. Fostering welcoming and inclusive communities and focusing on building an amazing UX are two things Carolyn always prioritized, and was always happy to help, mentor, and spend time helping people.

Whether it was talking about our favorite dumplings and ramen, or trying to solve difficult engineering problems, she was always there to help, uplift, and make things better.

You will be missed, Carolyn. ✨

## Catherine Paganini

Carolyn was an active and beloved member of our community. Dedicated and hardworking, she was always willing to lend a helping hand. Her commitment to providing open source projects with the tools they need to succeed played a crucial role in developing the TAG-CS Contributor Growth Working Group. Despite her many accomplishments, Carolyn remained humble and always eager to share her experiences and lessons learned with others. She was a wonderful human being, and her passing is a great loss to the entire community. We will greatly miss her 💔

## John Reese

Carolyn embodied people and community. Her talk on designing CLIs for _people_ at GopherCon 2019, my first Go conference, changed my perception of how we should be building software. Focus on the people, and everything else will fall into place. I had so many questions after the talk, too many for a single interaction that she invited me to a dinner that she and other Gophers were attending. She made me feel so welcome in the community, and it's something that I have never forgotten. You will be greatly missed, Carolyn. 🌈 ✨

## David Justice

Carolyn and I have worked on the same team for the past year and a half. I had admired her work from afar long before we ever had the opportunity to work on the same team. What I didn't realize from afar was Carolyn's immense gravity of personality. Teams adopt personality traits and behaviors of members, but not in equal amounts. Ours was influenced profoundly by Carolyn's kindness, equity, and love of community. She willed it to be through smiles, infectious laughter, cat pics, positivity, and boundless optimism.

As so many others in this memorial have attested, Carolyn was a uniquely talented engineer. She was the type of person to see the path from A to C without going through B. That is to say, she intuitively sensed solutions that were both pleasing to users and elegantly implemented. Carolyn was not just talented, but also driven. When she committed herself, you better help or get out the way, because Carolyn could not be stopped when she applied herself.

It is with profound sadness I say goodbye, Carolyn, but it has been a privilege to get to know you. Thank you, and we will all be missing you.

## Usman Malik

My heartfelt condolences on Carolyn's loss. She was a fantastic developer who made significant contributions to various projects, including Kubernetes, CNAB, and Porter. We say farewell to such a talented and dedicated individual with tremendous sadness.

Carolyn's inventive and boundary-pushing work left an everlasting influence on the IT industry throughout her career. Her love of her work was contagious, and she was a great inspiration to many.

As we reflect on Carolyn's life and accomplishments, let us remember her and the lasting impact she has had on the industry. For many years to come, her efforts will continue to impact and define the future of technology.

I extend my heartfelt sympathies to Carolyn's family and loved ones during this terrible time. She will be greatly missed, but her contributions to the tech community will live on. ✨

## Kim McMahon

I met Carolyn at my first KubeCon in Austin at one of the women networking events. I'm new to the community and I didn't know anyone. I put my extrovert hat on and walked up to this group of 3 women and started chatting. They were all technical and brillian engineers. And they talked to me! A 'marketing' person. 

Carolyn and I would run across each other occassionally and I'm sad to say I lost track of her (and many people :() during the pandemic. I will always remember her for her welcoming nature, smile, laugh, brilliance, and being part of the community.

My hugs and strength to Carolyn's family during this time. 

## Bridget Kromhout

Carolyn possessed keen engineering acumen and paired it with a powerful drive to build sustainable human-centered open source systems. Simply put, she saw the opportunity to make the world a better place, and she said yes.

I’ve appreciated working with her for years, sharing our days from collaborating on conferences to commenting on each other's cat pictures, while bonding over Great Lakes regional weather and being Central Time denizens of a Pacific Time world. Every day Carolyn brought encouragement to learn and share and laugh.

Carolyn’s enduring legacy lies in her mindful support of new participants in our technical endeavors via inclusive communities, welcoming documentation, and joyful emoji.🌈✨

## Bob Killen

Carolyn truly embodied the best of open source. Kind, patient, always willing to help and an amazing engineer. We first met back in the SIG Service Catalog days when I was just coming back into open source world and she went out of her way to make me feel welcomed. We bonded quickly exchanging pictures of our cats and memes...I'm dearly going to miss the random dm from her.

She was an inspiration and will forever be remembered. Her legacy will continue through the hundreds of people shes helped and guided.

Rest in peace, Carolyn. 🦄🌈

## Kent Rancourt

When I heard the news, I felt sick. I still do. Carolyn was a brilliant engineer, as so many have noted, but more importantly, she was a true friend. I had the privilege of working directly with her at times, but we spent many years in the same orbit. Even when not collaborating directly, she was a reliable confidant and sage source of advice. I could always count on Carolyn to back me up when I needed it, but I could also count on her to challenge me at times when I needed to see things from a different perspective. Sometimes, she was even a shoulder to cry on. I'm a better person for having had her in my life. Reading through all the tributes on this page, it's heartwarming, but not the least bit surprising, to see so many feel the same. Perhaps the thing that I admired most about her was her flare for building inclusive communities whose members not only felt safe, but also felt seen, heard, and inspired. On both the technical and _human_ level, Carolyn was the very embodiment of open source ideals. (On that note, I cannot help but smile at how fitting it is that our tributes to our friend and colleague take the form of _PRs_.) I will miss my friend dearly, but I know that I will be hearing her echoes in our community for years to come, especially in the form of the countless engineers she inspired and mentored... and every time I sense one of those echoes, I'll remember her warmly and smile.

Rest easy, my friend. ❤️🦄🖖


## Jerod Santo

I only had the pleasure of meeting Carolyn once, when we hosted her on Go Time in 2021. She was so kind, so thoughtful, and so downright _interesting_ (as both a technologist and as a person) that I later asked her to become a regular panelist on the show. Unfortunately for us, Carolyn declined the offer because she was already overcommitted. I wish I'd had the opportunity to get to know her better. She was special.

## Mat Ryer

Carolyn lit up any conversation. On many occasions I would see her surrounded by smiling faces at conferences where she was working hard to uplift and empower others. Her work in OSS and the Women Who Go group has touched countless lives, and unlocked new careers for many of those lucky enough to cross paths with her. Carolyn stands out as one of my favourite people, and I feel like the world is a little darker without her shining light.

## Nuno do Carmo

Carolyn welcomed me to the Cloud Native like no other. Back in 2018, I heard about Porter and wanted to test it "in my way". Carolyn helped me by answering basic questions, never getting mad or impatient, rather she was always motivating me to reach for the next level in understanding and encouraged me to make a demo on how I used Porter to the whole team. When I did it, she was actively pushing for me to come to KubeCon and with the help of close friends, I did attend my first KubeCon thanks to them. 

During that KubeCon, she guided me, whenever we had a session in common, she would seat next to me and we would talk about the session and also on how a friend of the speaker would **always** seat front row as a support. And that's what she was, even if it we were far away, she was my friend, my mentor and I became a better community member thanks to her. 

2 weeks ago, I was at KubeCon and she was not there, but our close friends were there. We made a picture and they send it to her. The next day they gave me her message: "I miss you very much". I replied I missed her too, a lot... Tu vas me manquer énormément mon amie ❤️

May you rest in peace, your legacy definitively lives on 🦄🌈

## Joshua Bezaleel Abednego
The chance I had to contributing to Porter and to know Carolyn was one of the best time I had in life, the one that I will always treasure for the rest of it. She was the kindest and the best of open source there is. She shaped the lives of so many people for the better. The interaction I had with her didn't just make me a better software engineer, but as Ralph said, she gave the example on how to be human and how to treat others. She made sure there's room for everyone which then she greeted with smile and welcoming hands. 

I hope her kindness and warmth lives on. Let's make sure her kindness and warmth lives on through each and everyone of us. In open source community, and in life. 

You will be dearly missed, Carolyn. Thank you for everything. Rest in love.
