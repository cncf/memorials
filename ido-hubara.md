# In Memory of Ido Hubara

Dear community and friends,

We thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Ido so all will know what a wonderful person he was.

## Itay Hindy

Ido joined our IBM Cloud security team almost 8 years ago as a student. From the first day it was clear that his contribution and influence on the team were much bigger than a regular student, probably a combination of being a reserve duty officer in the army and growing up in a Kibbutz in the Gaza strip.
As a developer he took ownership on major pieces in our product diving into new technologies without a fear. It was not long before he became the team leader and scrum master, where he maximized his influence on the product and people. He was always seeking for more things to do, looking on how to make things better, not afraid to speak up when needed and always with a smile and sense of humor.

I learned many things from Ido, but probably the most important lesson he taught me was that it is all about priorities. He worked hard and exceed all that he did, he was starting his day early in the morning, finishing late in the night but between 16:00 to 20:00 he was not working, he was with his kids, enjoying every minute with them. 

Ido was a hero as you should all know. He was born in Kibbutz Sufa and was killed there while protecting his family and the Kibbutz. Ido leaves behind three amazing and beautiful children and his wife Noa.

We will all miss him, we all grew up together since we joined IBM, we got married, got children. The only comfort I have in this terrible situation is the knowledge that in the last years Ido managed to spend a lot of time with his loved ones.

My heart goes to Ido Hubara’s young family.
Ido was murdered trying to protect his wife Neta, his 6YO boy Guy and his twin 3YO daughters, at his home, from the brutal murderous Hamas that infiltrated his Kibutz during the inhuman brutality that took place this last Saturday.
Ido was a Software Team Lead in IBM Cloud Security Services, always smiling, always friendly, always pleasant to work with, always calm. Someone you can always depend on.
He is just one name out of >1200 which were murdered this Saturday, many of them in their homes, with their families. I will personally miss him and hope that his family, like so many others, will find ways to overcome this atrocity.

Thanks to my IBMers for sharing this with me. I’m deeply saddened by this and hope Ido’s family and for all my friends in Israel are able to heal. He was fighting for his country and family, which makes him a war hero. Proud of him and to have known him. I will take the good memories of our time together with me. The last 1x1 video chat I had with Ido, he had a baby in his lap

OMG. Shocked. Speechless. Can’t believe this!! 
Ido is such a nice person, strong technical leader and always smiling with can-do attitude!! Such a wonderful colleague. I had the privilege and honor to have had him in my team and to have had great f2f discussions and evolving our tech capabilities. Still reeling from this terrible news. May his soul rest in peace!!

I’ve met Ido as my interviewer. Even though I never worked under him, I learned from him a lot about what’s important in life: The balance between family and work was your pinnacle. I’ll miss our random morning meetings on the train to work. Your calmness, humor and intelligence were what made you such a great team member and a leader.

Ido lived in Kibbutz Sufa which was a heaven on earth. hopefully, the Kibbutz will get back to what it was.
