Unlike tears that are triggered easily since we've heard the news, I've been struggling to find the words.
the right words to say to my colleagues that are grieving, or to friends asking me if we we're close.
The only thing that runs trough my head is our conversations. is your smile. is how you were always kind. you we're always smiling and shining. Lighting up the room. it's like you had an halo on comfort, of security, that you were carrying everywhere with you.
I don't have the words but I do have a mantra that you left within me, just by the way you made everyone feel, I hear it in every story and read it in every paragraph written about you.
And this "Gal Navon" mantra, that will now live in me, is to be kind, to be welcoming. To spread light, even in times of anger and darkness.
It will take a lot of us trying to be better in that way for it to accumulate even remotely to the light you brought. 

Rest in peace Gal. 
You're missed already.
