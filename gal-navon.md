## Or Frenkel
Gal was a team leader at Melio. As Gal's direct manager, I can confidently say that he was not only a colleague but also a true friend to everyone. He was beacon of happiness and positivity, and his intelligence was exceptional. 
His ability to give accurate feedback was unparalleled, and he had a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.

During onboarding, I drew an ERD on a whiteboard. Based on my past experience, I knew I would need to redraw it as the model is complex for new joiners.
Gal wrote things in his notebook and nodded his head.
After two days, he sent me a Miro board that perfectly explained our entity model.

Gal, in Hebrew, meaning 'wave', as waves carry things away and bring new treasures to shore. It's a cycle of loss and discovery that reminds me of Gal, whose life was taken too soon. Each wave that retreats seems to take a piece of the grief with it, while every new wave brings a memory of joy.
