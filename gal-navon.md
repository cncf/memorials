Gal was my team leader at Melio. He was an exceptional manager, surprisingly young, but with the experience of someone a decade above his actual age.
He brought joy and happiness to the team every day. One of his routines was to bless every team member with a cheerful good morning blessing in the daily meetings.
It was clear that he took the responsibility to bring out the best in every teammate, and show it to everyone.
He always told us to communicate in public channels about our work’s output, letting everyone know what we’ve achieved. That made us feel impactful.

Gal was kind, modest, brilliant, and hilarious.
We could have spoken nonsense for a while and then in one moment to focus and talk business.
He had a natural gift of looking at people’s eyes, reading their feelings, and being mindful of their needs.
He always knew to give the right advice, his tips always worked, and he taught me how to remove my blockers and overcome my challenges.

Since October 7th, Gal has always been on my mind. I wish we could have had many more moments together.
