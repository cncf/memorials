Gal was a team leader at Melio. As Gal's direct manager, I can confidently say that he was not only a colleague but also a true friend to everyone. He was beacon of happiness and positivity, and his intelligence was exceptional. 
His ability to give accurate feedback was unparalleled, and he had a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.

During onboarding, I drew an ERD on a whiteboard. Based on my past experience, I knew I would need to redraw it as the model is complex for new joiners.
Gal wrote things in his notebook and nodded his head.
After two days, he sent me a Miro board that perfectly explained our entity model.

Gal, in Hebrew, meaning 'wave', as waves carry things away and bring new treasures to shore. It's a cycle of loss and discovery that reminds me of Gal, whose life was taken too soon. Each wave that retreats seems to take a piece of the grief with it, while every new wave brings a memory of joy.

The irony is that the person who would be best suited to write this memorial is Sefi Genis, Gal's closest friend, who died with him in the October 7th massacre.
They died heroes together, fighting off terrorists with their bare hands to save the people that were hiding in the bunker with them. This just demonstrates how Gal was all kindness, and put everyone before himself. 
He lived as a mensch, and died a hero on October 7th. The [#tlvcommunity](https://tlvcommunity.dev) will remember him forever.
