Gal was my direct manager,
It was always funny with him, every time he returned to his table I knew he would say something and we would laugh. Every meeting we had, I always knew we would laugh at something that might happen.
He had a high emotional intelligence and the level of care for the people around him was at the top, it gave a lot of strength with positive energies, and the feeling of "there is someone to trust" is in the space of the room.
Every decision he made was made seriously and calmly thinking about the smallest details, it was inspiring every time he broke down a huge problem by writing a few lines in his notebook.
