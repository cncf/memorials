You cannot recruit Gal anymore.

He was the employee you were looking for.
He was talented and thorough in everything he did.

Passionate and a team player: the person who walks to his desk and makes anyone around him look up from their screens and smile. Starting each day with the happiest and most energetic 'good morning,' as if it's the first exciting day of a new startup every day.
Good morning, Zohar. Good morning, Ori. Good morning, Sveta...! It's not just task updates; it's team and personal care, and uplifting. For each update, he replies, "Awesome," "Super," "Amazing," even if he pushed, "Let's keep up the pace" or "Let's make sure we finish it up today."
His top goal (I think) was to ensure the team feels valuable, doing meaningful things. He kept looking for more ways to show our progress and give each developer the opportunity to present their work.

Project Management: Gal would take on any task, starting by understanding the logic and reasoning himself, making sure all relevant team members have a broad understanding of it, and then dividing it into milestones and smaller tasks. He made sure that the progress would be visible so that each developer could see their contribution and respond with, "Excellent," "Amazing," "Great!"
We used to laugh about you waking up every 3 hours at and satying home just to take care of your cat's eye. You took care of the drops timing like you took care of everything and everyone.

Fluent in many languages: Obviously Hebrew,English and code, but also the language of people and souls â€“ sensitive to everyone around him, reading their eyesand the room, communicating through all channels. Ensuring that people took the time they needed for vacations, family, and health.

Time management: All meetings were scheduled in advance, managed to be focused and impactful. 

We had a problem with our weekly meetings; we needed more time than scheduled, and we were both always rushing between meetings. We would smile at each other, finishing "one more thing" before our delayed meeting, and then, most of the time, we'd continue our meeting the next day.

I could go on and on, but I need to leave now for Gal's funeral.
No more smiles or coffee, no more happy 'good morning' each day, no more watching you play ping pong just for fun while keeping everything on track.

Milestones are just stones now, and my heart is broken.

Say something good to your colleagues or loved ones today, let them see that you see them, and appreciate their achievements. Try to open with a happy 'Good morning,' thinking of Gal. I'm not sure I can do that anytime soon, but I'll keep trying.

I love you, Gal. You will be so missed.
