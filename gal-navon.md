## Sharone Revah Zitzman
The irony is that the person who would be best suited to write this memorial is Sefi Genis, Gal's closest friend, who died with him in the October 7th massacre.
They died heroes together, fighting off terrorists with their bare hands to save the people that were hiding in the bunker with them. This just demonstrates how Gal was all kindness, and put everyone before himself. 
He lived as a mensch, and died a hero on October 7th. The [#tlvcommunity](https://tlvcommunity.dev) will remember him forever.
