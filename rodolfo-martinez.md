I am deeply saddened to say goodbye to a dear friend and a true pillar of the Cloud Native communities in Mexico and LATAM. Rodo always looked for the "how" to make things happen, always willing to share, build, and inspire. His passion for the community was contagious, inspiring everyone around him to get involved and give their best. His energy and generosity left a mark that will live on in every community, every project, and every person fortunate enough to have known him.

Gracias por todo, Rodo, Te rifaste. You leave us a legacy that will continue to grow.

## Katie Greenley

I had the honor of getting to know and work with Rodolfo through the CNCF ambassador program. His passion to support and grow his community was inspiring.
He truly embodied the spirit of open source with his collabortive, and contributive nature. He was always happy to help. His legacy of contributing to projects like
KCD Guadalajara, translating the CNCF glossary and Kubenetes docs into Spanish, and being part of the Kubernetes Release Team.

I will miss him, as he was always a friendly face at events and I enjoyed hearing about the next thing he was doing to help support the community. He will be very missed
by the LATAM community.

## Victor Morales

I had the privilege of working with Rodo on multiple initiatives over the past few years,
and I want to share just a few of the many things that made him the extraordinary person he was.

First and foremost was his true community spirit.
Guadalajara is well known for its vibrant tech communities, inspired by Silicon Valley models.
Rodo, who grew up in Mexico City, decided early in his career to move to Guadalajara to pursue his dream of being part of this thriving ecosystem.

He co-founded the Go Lang community and played a key role in reviving the Cloud Native community.
Not stopping there, he was instrumental in organizing both Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs)
in Guadalajara‚Äîtaking the lead on the second one until leukemia forced him to step back.
His active contributions to translating the CNCF glossary and Kubernetes documentation into Spanish were essential in achieving those projects' success.

I learned many things from him‚Äînot only as a professional but, more importantly, as a friend.
His passing is a tremendous loss for the CNCF LATAM community.
We will deeply miss him. I hope his family, like so many of us, will find strength in his legacy and the lives he touched.

## Edith Puclla

I met Rodolfo through his contributions to the Kubernetes documentation, especially in translating from English to Spanish. I was impressed by his strong focus on community and his mindset of always delivering excellent work.
I had the opportunity to attend one of his talks alongside V√≠ctor Morales in Guadalajara, Mexico, and it was inspiring to see all that they achieved together in the Spanish translation community.

Rodolfo was collaborative, diligent caring for his team, always contributing, providing, and striving for something better, all with an incredible smile and humility.

Rodolfo, I will always remember you for what you were: a great human being and an example to follow.

My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

Thank you for evertything, Rodolfo and rest in peace. üåπ

Rodolfo had a profound impact and was a true inspiration in how he shared his knowledge, time, dedication, and charisma with the community.

I first met him while working on the Kubernetes Spanish localization team alongside V√≠ctor. He was always there to support and help everyone, making a real difference‚Äîespecially for beginners or newcomers to the group.

He actively contributed to Kubernetes releases and inspired me to apply as well. He never hesitated to answer my questions, no matter how small.

After almost three years together in the Spanish localization team, Rodolfo became not just a colleague but a friend. It was a joy to meet him in person at several Kubecons, the last time in Salt Lake City‚Äîwhere we spoke, as always, about how to collaborate and support the Latin American community.

We will deeply miss his presence. Until the very end, he was contributing, answering questions, and merging pull requests for the community.

Those of us who had the privilege to know him will never forget his kindness and his unwavering dedication to helping others.

Rest in peace, Rodolfo. My heartfelt condolences and a warm embrace to his family and friends during this difficult time.

From where you are, you will always be an inspiration, and we will strive to follow in your footsteps.

## Abraham L√≥pez

I met Rodo in 2018 while working at a startup incubator in Guadalajara, Jalisco, M√©xico. He moved from Estado de M√©xico to Guadalajara in order to pursue his dream. Leaving your familiy behind and everything you are familiar with must be incredible hard.

He was a Python developer who gladly took the challenge of becoming a Front-End developer. He was the kind of man that, whenever he set a goal for himself, worked relentlessly towards it until he was succesful. Yes, he became a great FE dev, I'm sure he was fantastic at infrastructure tasks as well.

His love for finances got him a position in a fintech startup owned by the incubator we worked at. He was a perfect fit. We then parted ways and pursued different careers in different companies. But, I deeply missed his contagious laugh, super-friendly manners and his constant state of joy.

He and Gustavo D√≠az created GoLang GDL. He contributed to open source. Bought his own apartment before he was 30, it's worth saying that Guadalajara's real state is not exactly buyer friendly. Got a girlfriend. Proposed to her in Paris. And, left a mark in everyone who had the pleasure of working with him.

Rodomar, Ramrodo, Rodo, you are an inspiration to us all. You will be missed.

_"What is grief, if not love persevering?"_

## Lee Calcote

I mourn the loss of Rodolfo, a cherished member of the CNCF community whose passion and dedication left its mark. I first met Rodolfo at a conference workshop I hosted in Guadalajara, Mexico. Rodolfo's enthusiasm for learning and contributing shone brightly. He was eager to join the Meshery project. Over time, his consistent engagement and collaborative spirit earned him a well-deserved role as a maintainer, leading our CI working group with skill and commitment.

Rodolfo‚Äôs impact extended far beyond Meshery, touching many corners of the CNCF community. His warmth, curiosity, and drive to make a difference inspired those around him. Though it had been too long since we last spoke, his contributions and spirit will live on. Among many other places, Rodolfo‚Äôs legacy is forever honored in his Layer5 community member profile - https://layer5.io/community/members/rodolfo-martinez-vega.

Rest in peace, Rodolfo.

üñ§ **In Memory of Rodolfo Martinez Vega ‚Äì Rodo** üñ§

Today, my heart and the entire **Cloud Native LATAM** community are in mourning. We‚Äôve lost a dear friend, colleague, and true community leader: **Rodolfo Martinez Vega**, **CNCF Ambassador**, whose active work in translating the **CNCF glossary** and **Kubernetes documentation into Spanish** was key to the success of those projects and to making knowledge accessible to thousands of developers across the region.

Rodo was one of the first to believe in initiatives like _La Hora de Kubernetes_. His help in the translation tag for Kubernetes documentation ‚Äîand so many other projects‚Äî was fundamental. He was always ready to contribute, invite others to join, and inspire people to follow his lead.

I met him in person at **KubeCon Amsterdam 2023**, and from then on we shared so many moments: **KCD Medell√≠n, El Salvador, Guadalajara**‚Ä¶ The last time we saw each other was at **KubeCon Salt Lake 2024**, where we spent three days each fighting for our causes ‚Äîhe for **KCD Guadalajara** and I for Colombia. I‚Äôll never forget that cold night outside the convention center, both of us with dead phones, sitting on the stairs charging from a portable battery, swapping stories, dreams, and life plans. Those memories are treasures I‚Äôll carry in my heart.

He spoke at our **Fellowship by Cloud Native LATAM**, I met his fianc√©e, and we shared personal and professional moments that made me admire him even more. One of his biggest wishes was to overcome leukemia and be able to contribute to open source again ‚Äîsomething he was truly passionate about.

Rodo, the LATAM community and our ambassadors‚Äô group will miss you so much. Thank you for your friendship, your example, and your generosity.

Vuela alto Rodo! üñ§

In Memory of Rodolfo ‚ÄúRodo‚Äù Mart√≠nez Vega

I met Rodo in 2023 at KubeCon Amsterdam ‚Äî our first in-person KubeCon. From the very first hours of day one, it was friendship at first sight. It felt like we‚Äôd known each other for years, not hours. That was Rodo‚Äôs magic: he made strangers feel like lifelong friends in minutes.

Rodo was the kind of person who didn‚Äôt wait to be asked ‚Äî he just jumped right in to help. Unselfish to his core, he gave his time, energy, and heart to everyone around him. He didn‚Äôt blink twice before stepping up to help us with KCD Colombia, and he championed contributions across multiple projects, including the Spanish localization efforts.

He was more than just a CNCF Ambassador ‚Äî he was a bridge-builder, especially for Latin America. Rodo believed in opening doors, breaking down barriers, and making the tech community a place where everyone could belong. His kindness was constant, his enthusiasm contagious, and his impact undeniable.

We‚Äôre going to miss him deeply ‚Äî his laugh, his encouragement, and the way he always knew how to make you feel supported. Rest in peace, my friend. Watch over us, and guide us to always do the right thing. Your legacy will keep inspiring us to build, to help, and to connect ‚Äî just as you always did.

Gracias, Rodo. You made our community and our lives better.

I admired Rodo's passion and dedication for Open Source, he has been a big part of the success of the CNCF and helped scale the community making it inclusive to all not only for LATAM but also APAC. This has helped change the world for good, empowering other regions with education, mentoring and collabration to leverage cloud native technology.

I first met him online on the Kubernetes Release team, where I was the Comms release lead, and it was very challenging for me due to being in the APAC timezone. Rodo and Caro helped and taught me a lot during the release and had my back when the workload got intense near the end. I was lucky to continue doing 3 releases with him.

The first time we met in person was in Detroit for the sig-release meeting at the Kubernetes contributor summit. Rodo knew I could speak spanish as I used to once live in his home city, Guadalajara, so we spoke in spanish.  This was special to me as many Spanish speakers also speak in English and eventually default back to English, but Rodo held speaking in Spanish the whole time, which I respected a lot. This is when I knew how good a mentor he was and the value that he gave to the world.

Rest in peace, Rodo! :blue_heart:

Para la familia y amigos que est√°n leyendo esto, deber√≠an estar muy orgullosos de Rodo. Fue un gran mentor para m√≠ y aprend√≠ mucho de √©l. Sus contribuciones a la tecnolog√≠a y la comunidad tuvieron un impacto positivo en el mundo, ampliando las oportunidades para aprender, usar y adoptar tecnolog√≠a nativa de la nube.

Building and nurturing the Kubernetes Community takes time and effort. This has
been especially difficult in Mexico, as there has been little engagement, and
often talks and presentations don't produce much results. But every now and
then, you find that one person who makes it all worthwhile.

This was Rodolfo for me.

I met Rodolfo on Twitter after giving a talk about the K8s Release Team
at a Mexican open source conference in 2020. I was not expecting much traction
but right after I was done, he DM'ed me and wanted to sign up.
He simply got it. Rodo was built of what this community has always needed:
Kindness, passion to help others and love for the project.

And so began an amazing journey. I could not be prouder as I saw Rodo get
involved with SIG Release, climb through the Release Team ladder and become a
CNCF ambassador while organizing KCD Mexico. Soon, I was learning from him, 
in awe of how much he had accomplished.

I saw him for the last time at Kubecon in SLC, he was so happy to have landed a
new job at Lyft and it just filled my heart seeing how much he had grown. I
will miss him terribly.

Gracias por todo Rodolfo, te quiero cabr√≥n.

## Thiago Mowszet

Today we say goodbye to someone who left a huge mark on our community.
Your commitment to Go and open source was truly inspiring, always bringing the energy and willingness to help everyone grow together.

I was lucky to meet you at a [Go Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaWTGEpsAs4) we organized, and I‚Äôll never forget how you stepped up to take the whole event on your shoulders, helping with every detail and even arranging giveaways for the community. That generous and collaborative spirit is something we‚Äôll miss deeply ‚Äî and also what will keep inspiring us to move forward.

Thank you for everything you gave, Rodo. The community will always remember you. üíô

## Abraham Alfaro

Rodolfo was one of the first people recommended to me to contact to learn more about the CNCF community in Mexico. Rodo was always eager to help people interested in these movements.

You will always be an inspiration to everyone in the Latin American community. The legacy you left behind and the experiences you shared with those interested were truly remarkable.

Thank you, Rodo.
