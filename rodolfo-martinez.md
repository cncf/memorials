I had the privilege of working with Rodo on multiple initiatives over the past few years,
and I want to share just a few of the many things that made him the extraordinary person he was.

First and foremost was his true community spirit.
Guadalajara is well known for its vibrant tech communities, inspired by Silicon Valley models.
Rodo, who grew up in Mexico City, decided early in his career to move to Guadalajara to pursue his dream of being part of this thriving ecosystem.

He co-founded the Go Lang community and played a key role in reviving the Cloud Native community.
Not stopping there, he was instrumental in organizing both Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs)
in Guadalajara—taking the lead on the second one until leukemia forced him to step back.
His active contributions to translating the CNCF glossary and Kubernetes documentation into Spanish were essential in achieving those projects' success.

I learned many things from him—not only as a professional but, more importantly, as a friend.
His passing is a tremendous loss for the CNCF LATAM community.
We will deeply miss him. I hope his family, like so many of us, will find strength in his legacy and the lives he touched.
